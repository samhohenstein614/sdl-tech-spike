# Running the project

To run the project, all you have to do is navigate to the `app` folder in a terminal and run the following command:
`docker compose up -d` and then navigate to `localhost:3000`. NOTE: when deployed, this will be on port 3000 for whatever URL
you are using. Also note that if you make changes to the front end, you will want to use `docker compose up -d --build`.
